# The United States Political System

With document will service as research notes. The United States political system is large and expansive. There are many large rabbitholes one can go down when researching the rules and entities that makeup and run the government.

## Congressional Research Service

[Congressional Research Service](https://crsreports.congress.gov/), "Informing the legislative debate since 1914."

From the [Library of Congress](https://loc.gov/crsinfo/), "The Congressional Research Service (CRS) works exclusively for the United States Congress, providing policy and legal analysis to committees and Members of both the House and Senate, regardless of party affiliation. As a legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress, CRS has been a valued and respected resource on Capitol Hill for more than a century.

CRS is well-known for analysis that is authoritative, confidential, objective and nonpartisan. Its highest priority is to ensure that Congress has 24/7 access to the nation’s best thinking."

Questions:

- What information does this service provide?
- How in-depth / rigorous / scientific is the information?
- What sources is the information drawn from?
- Is there an overall political leaning of the entity?
- What is the political leaning of the individual authors, if there is one?
- Who else, besides Congress, uses this information?
