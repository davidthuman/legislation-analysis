The Supreme Court has affirmed that the <quote>substantive scope</quote> of the Elections Clause is <quote>broad</quote>; that <quote>Times, Places, and Manner</quote> are <quote>comprehensive words which embrace authority to provide for a complete code for congressional elections</quote>; and <quote>[t]he power of Congress over the Times, Places and Manner of congressional elections is paramount, and may be exercised at any time, and to any extent which it deems expedient; and so far as it is exercised, and no farther, the regulations effected supersede those of the State which are inconsistent therewith</quote>.

In seven States—Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming—more than one in seven African Americans is disenfranchised, twice the national average for African Americans.

Of the 5,200,000 citizens barred from voting then, only 24 percent were in prison. By contrast, 75 percent of persons disenfranchised then resided in their communities while on probation or parole or after having completed their sentences. Approximately 2,200,000 citizens who had completed their sentences were disenfranchised due to restrictive State laws. As of November 2018, the lifetime ban for persons with certain felony convictions was eliminated through a Florida ballot initiative. As a result, as many as 1,400,000 people are now eligible to have their voting rights restored. In 4 States—Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee—more than 7 percent of the total population is disenfranchised.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H3CA91EBE50DF47149D00544759BF4341"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In those States that disenfranchise individuals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often granted in a non-uniform and potentially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised individuals sometimes must either obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor or an action by the parole or pardon board, depending on the offense and State. Individuals convicted of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to regaining voting rights.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H35AC5D3D2DE34451AE00D68D2D795395"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Many felony disenfranchisement laws today derive directly from post-Civil War efforts to stifle the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Between 1865 and 1880, at least 14 states—Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas—enacted or expanded their felony disenfranchisement laws. One of the primary goals of these laws was to prevent African Americans from voting. Of the states that enacted or expanded their felony disenfranchisement laws during this post-Civil War period, at least 11 continue to preclude persons on felony probation or parole from voting. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="idE766C93DB4CA41F0BC8A9F9364642A7A"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Latino citizens are also disproportionately disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate representation in the criminal justice system. In recent years, Latinos have been imprisoned at 2.5 times the rate of Whites. More than 2 percent of the voting-age Latino population, or 560,000 Latinos, are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 34 states Latinos are disenfranchised at a higher rate than the general population. In 11 states 4 percent or more of Latino adults are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction (Alabama, 4 percent; Arizona, 7 percent; Arkansas, 4 percent; Idaho, 4 percent; Iowa, 4 percent; Kentucky, 6 percent; Minnesota, 4 percent; Mississippi, 5 percent; Nebraska, 6 percent; Tennessee, 11 percent; Wyoming, 4 percent), twice the national average for Latinos. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="H7AB2704527084E86876F53B147016F3E"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a criminal offense and who are living and working in the community serves no compelling State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2120D65EE5D04D2BAA82E2DBB1F030E"><enum>(12)</enum><text>State disenfranchisement laws can suppress electoral participation among eligible voters by discouraging voting among family and community members of disenfranchised persons. Future electoral participation by the children of disenfranchised parents may be impacted as well. Models of successful re-entry for persons convicted of a crime emphasize the importance of community ties, feeling vested and integrated, and prosocial attitudes. Individuals with criminal convictions who succeed in avoiding recidivism are typically more likely to see themselves as law-abiding members of the community. Restoration of voting rights builds those qualities and facilitates reintegration into the community. That is why allowing citizens with criminal convictions who are living in a community to vote is correlated with a lower likelihood of recidivism. Restoration of voting rights thus reduces violence and protects public safety. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB6508BF42BD745CDA274E1BB771897F" commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline"><enum>(13)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The United States is one of the only Western democracies that permits the permanent denial of voting rights for individuals with felony convictions.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id08ebe3f2f80d40c7a86c2dcdda8a216f"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments <quote>guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.</quote> (Roper v.

Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 59 (2010)). Many State disenfranchisement laws are grossly disproportional to the offenses that lead to disenfranchisement and thus violate the bar on cruel and unusual punishments. For example, a number of states mandate lifetime disenfranchisement for a single felony conviction or just two felony convictions, even where the convictions were for non-violent offenses. In numerous other States, disenfranchisement can last years or even decades while individuals remain on probation or parole, often only because a person cannot pay their legal financial obligations. These kinds of extreme voting bans run afoul of the Eighth Amendment.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="idafab3de3c6b343c89a9a69ef4bda7f0b"><enum>(15)</enum><text>The Twenty-Fourth Amendment provides that the right to vote <quote>shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.</quote>. Section 2 of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Court fines and fees that individuals must pay to have their voting rights restored constitute an <quote>other tax</quote> for purposes of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. At least five States explicitly require the payment of fines and fees before individuals with felony convictions can have their voting rights restored. More than 20 other states effectively tie the right to vote to the payment of fines and fees, by requiring that individuals complete their probation or parole before their rights are restored. In these States, the non-payment of fines and fees is a basis on which probation or parole can be extended. Moreover, these states sometimes do not record the basis on which an individual’s probation or parole was extended, making it impossible to determine from the State’s records whether non-payment of fines and fees is the reason that an individual remains on probation or parole. For these reasons, the only way to ensure that States do not deny the right to vote based solely on non-payment of fines and fees is to prevent States from conditioning voting rights on the completion of probation or parole. </text></paragraph></section><section id="H66722FADFC4E43489BBADEF2374E9860"><enum>1403.</enum><header>Rights of citizens</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged because that individual has been convicted of a criminal offense unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility at the time of the election.</text></section><section id="H096F7FA1E3574359925BEBA7882F5B8A"><enum>1404.</enum><header>Enforcement</header><subsection id="HA4F5D555A8F94CA88A8DDFEAE004EF7D"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Attorney general</header><text>The Attorney General may, in a civil action, obtain such declaratory or injunctive relief as is necessary to remedy a violation of this subtitle.</text></subsection><subsection id="HCD5C92741AFC4E8EAB6DD9A420BB80BB"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Private right of action</header><paragraph id="H4D3F6C86B1694AB5BE52BA95E7A5AA52"><enum>(1)</enum><header>In general</header><text>A person who is aggrieved by a violation of this subtitle may provide written notice of the violation to the chief election official of the State involved.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H5166697883BE4E7385D7A0356008E908"><enum>(2)</enum><header>Relief</header><text>Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the violation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice under paragraph (1), or within 20 days after receipt of the notice if the violation occurred within 120 days before the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person may, in a civil action, obtain declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H0C168A05D9474AB69F6EF6A35AB801DB"><enum>(3)</enum><header>Exception</header><text>If the violation occurred within 30 days before the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person need not provide notice to the chief election official of the State under paragraph (1) before bringing a civil action to obtain declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation.</text></paragraph></subsection></section><section id="H5D0B561DEB6A48E6A7EF8595BD861E76"><enum>1405.</enum><header>Notification of restoration of voting rights</header><subsection id="H26D454871E2949F8B11336F69248E995"><enum>(a)</enum><header>State notification</header><paragraph id="H7FF0876B11134AB784C509664FFFC67C"><enum>(1)</enum><header>Notification</header><text>On the date determined under paragraph (2), each State shall—</text><subparagraph id="id86CC15321A0643FFB37A27370ADD7B55"><enum>(A)</enum><text>notify in writing any individual who has been convicted of a criminal offense under the law of that State that such individual—</text><clause id="idF084E9D2174E4C89A5489ACAA3FE8BA6"><enum>(i)</enum><text>has the right to vote in an election for Federal office pursuant to the <short-title>Democracy Restoration Act of 2021</short-title>;

Although the Court has upheld other content-neutral laws like these, it has failed to apply to same logic to campaign finance laws. These flawed decisions have empowered large corporations, extremely wealthy individuals, and special interests to dominate election spending, corrupt our politics, and degrade our democracy through tidal waves of unlimited and anonymous spending. These decisions also stand in contrast to a long history of efforts by Congress and the States to regulate money in politics to protect democracy, and they illustrate a troubling deregulatory trend in campaign finance-related court decisions.

not a candidate were running for office, like childcare and food. While the law seems neutral, its actual effect is to privilege the independently wealthy who want to run, because given the demands of running for office, candidates who must work to pay for childcare or to afford health insurance are effectively being left out of the process, even if they have sufficient support to mount a viable campaign.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H497C2EB30782485385364AE4E27B72FD"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Thus current practice favors those prospective candidates who do not need to rely on a regular paycheck to make ends meet. The consequence is that everyday Americans who have firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable childcare, a safety net, or great public schools are less likely to get a seat at the table. This governance by the few is antithetical to the democratic experiment, but most importantly, when lawmakers do not share the concerns of everyday Americans, their policies reflect that.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC27D997549DB4829A27A51F3EE959BDF"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">These circumstances have contributed to a Congress that does not always reflect everyday Americans. The New York Times reported in 2019 that fewer than 5 percent of representatives cite blue-collar or service jobs in their biographies. A 2015 survey by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that the median net worth of lawmakers was just over $1 million in 2013, or 18 times the wealth of the typical American household.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H5F8570C40243481992A09F086E755A3B"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">These circumstances have also contributed to a governing body that does not reflect the nation it serves. For instance, women are 51 percent of the American population. Yet even with a record number of women serving in the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress, the Pew Research Center notes that more than three out of four Members of this Congress are male. The Center for American Women And Politics found that one third of women legislators surveyed had been actively discouraged from running for office, often by political professionals. This type of discouragement, combined with the prohibitions on using campaign funds for domestic needs like childcare, burdens that still fall disproportionately on American women, particularly disadvantages working mothers. These barriers may explain why only 10 women in history have given birth while serving in Congress, in spite of the prevalence of working parents in other professions. Yet working mothers and fathers are best positioned to create policy that reflects the lived experience of most Americans.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC3694109618B4990BEDF5F320E9D7C0B"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Working mothers, those caring for their elderly parents, and young professionals who rely on their jobs for health insurance should have the freedom to run to serve the people of the United States.

representatives who more accurately reflect the experiences, challenges, and ideals of everyday Americans.</text></subsection></section><section id="HE79248D283544DAFBB4444571C54BA55"
