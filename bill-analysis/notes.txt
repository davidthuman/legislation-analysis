For gathering word stats, download the html from the Congress.gov website of the TXT showing.
Use html parser beautifulSoup to find the tag that parents the text that is in the bill
Its id = 'billTextContainer'

For showing bills in the bill-system project, fuck pdfs, we are going to use the given html to present the bill
This will actually be easier and cleaner to do, stop obsessing over pdfs
